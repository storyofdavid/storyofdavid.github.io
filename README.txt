This is a sample repo - that I set up to teach others how to host a static website for free using github.
##### Sample website: https://storyofdavid.github.io
# Steps on how to create your free website


  - Create an account at https://github.com/
  Your website url will be username.github.io so create a relevant username that you would like.
  - Start a project/create repository
  - Name it username.github.io, where username is your username on GitHub. Leave everything else as default and Create Repository.
  - On the next page you will see "Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file."
  Click on "uploading an existing file"

## Find a template
 - Find either a HTML or bootstrap template that you would like to use.
  Here are two websites that offer good free templates that you can use, choose one and download it:
  https://templated.co/
  https://html5up.net/
- Unzip the contents and upload them into github (you can drag and drop). Be sure to select the files underneath the parent     folder. For example I downloaded a file called html5up-stellar.zip. I unzipped it. I then opened the html5up-stellar folder   and uploaded the files within it (5 files, 2 folders).
- Click on "Commit Changes"
- Congrats - you now have a live website.
  Go to your site and check it out. your url will be your username.github.io

## Next Steps
 - Now that you have a working website, you will want to edit it and make changes.
 - Go to your website using Google Chrome Web Browser
 - Decide on what you would like to edit, for example the heading.
  Right click it and select "inspect"
 - This will open up some code. In this case its: <h1>Stellar</h1>
 - Go to your github repository and open up your index.html page.
 - Click on the pencil icon to edit the file, search for the section of code you would like to edit and replace the title with   the text your would like. eg. Replace <h1>Stellar</h1> with <h1>My New Title</h1>
 - Click commit changes to save them.
 - Rinse and repeat
